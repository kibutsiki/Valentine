                <p class = "content"> My dearest love, no words or numbers can describe my affection for you. You're not just a great girlfriend, you're my greatest joy. Everything you do bring me happiness, whether its your thoughtful gifts, gestures, affectionate touches, I remember them and I keep them to memory. Everymoment spent with you is like a safe, I want to hold those memory, keep them there, and cherish them. when you're by my side, time goes by faster, each hour feeling like minutes have just passed. But when you're not around every minute feels like an eternity, its as if I need you near. In class I always want your touch, to be able to hug u and hold u tightly in my arms, thinking about how to make you happy. sometime i ponder into the future because you're not nearby, what our kids will look like, how our lives will look like, how many troubles we will go through together. I say troubles because there is no great relationship with no troubles, but these troubles I hope we can work through it together and be with each other at the end of the day. You are my everything, my love, my happiness, I am greatly for your love and presence inside my life.</p>
